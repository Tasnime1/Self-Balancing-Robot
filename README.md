# Self-Balancing-Robot

- 2-wheel hoverboard-like self balancing robot using PID Control
</br></br>
- Used MPU6050 sensor to read the inclination angle angle,</br>
- then applied PID Algorithm to get a suitable output motor speed directly proportional to the error, </br>
- and finally sent this speed to the motors to balance the robot. </br></br>
- You can find more about the tuning process and more stuff in the documentaion file.
- Here's a video for the robot in action -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RAsdHcQ7Ni1EUoCmfVHH4cLycKm2xJl2/view?usp=share_link
