# Self-Balancing-Robot :car:

:star2: two-wheel hoverboard-like self balancing robot using PID Controller.

:star2: Used the MPU6050 sensor to read the inclination angle,</br>

:star2: then applied the PID Algorithm to get a suitable output motor speed directly proportional to the error, </br>

:star2: and finally sent this speed to the motors to balance the robot. </br></br>

:star2: You can find more about the tuning process and other stuff in the documentaion file.

:star2: Here's a video for the robot in action:arrow_forward:https://rb.gy/kzzo0
